Display random hex characters in a terminal in an amusing way

I wrote this to refamiliarize myself with curses programming.  Like the descriptions says, it displays random characters in a terminal in an amusing way.

This is very simple and not clean or thoroughly thought out.  It doesn't do anything dangerous, but use it at your own risk anyway.

Install ncurses-dev and type "make run".
